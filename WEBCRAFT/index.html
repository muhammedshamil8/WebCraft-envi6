                <h1>GRAND THEFT AUTO</h1>
                <p>Grand Theft Auto VI is an action-adventure game played from either a first-person or third-person
                    view.
                    Players complete missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the story.
                    Outside of
                    the missions, players may freely roam the open world. Composed of the San Andreas open countryside
                    area,
                    including the fictional Blaine County, and the fictional city of Los Santos, the world is much
                    larger in
                    area than earlier entries in the series. It may be fully explored after the game's beginning without
                    restriction, although story progress unlocks more gameplay content.</p>
